        <h2>Academical Projects</h2>
        <p><strong>ENSAM projects:</strong></p>
	<p><slide><a href="cloakroom.html">Cloakroom improvement</a>: during this extra-curricular project, I improved the previous cloakroom by using new technologies and processes to reduce the takt time</slide>
	<p><slide><a href="exchanger.html">Water heater dimensioning</a>: starting only with the technical specifications imposed, we had to design a water heater in order to heat up 200 liters of water from 293 to 328 Kelvin degrees in 2 hours. This solo project required a 3D modelling part to design the 200-liter water tank with the heating device in it. Secondly, I had to run various fluid mechanics analysis of air and water flow during the heating of it to validate the specifications imposed such as the heating time and change the design to improve heat transfers rate</slide></p>
	<p><slide><a href="factory_robot.html">Robot factory development</a>: starting from a video of a man disassembling an actuator we had to imagine, thanks to the Robot DK software and the robot database linked with, an optimized automated solution to respect the technical specifications of the factory. The disassembling process had to run in less than 2 minutes During this project, I personally designed a visual detection system recognizing various specific shapes in Python. As a team, we worked together on the decision-making process of the dismantling line. After our brainstorming, we decided to work with 2 independent robots to reduce the process time to only 32s. However, we hade to create a decision tree who could face all the configuration in which the actuator would be detected in. </slide></p>
      	<p><strong>Preparatory classes project:</strong></p>
	<p><slide><a href="TIPE.html">TIPE</a>: This project was a 2-people project for nationwide entrance examination to Grandes Ecoles (graduate schools). My friend and I, both devoted rugby men, were worried about our sport’s future and more precisely about lacks of players security during tackles which could lead to irreversible nervous system damage or even death. The two main parts of this project were: the electrical part with the sensors linked to the impact point signal treatment and the mechanical part with the spring design. </slide></p>
	<p><strong>High School project:</strong></p>
	<p><slide><a href="academical_project_snowb.html">Snowboost</a>: This device helps snowboarders moving when they are stuck on a flat surface so they don't have to untight their boots to push by themself</slide></p>
