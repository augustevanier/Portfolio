        <h2>Study and design of a cloakroom for the "Nuit des Fignos" Gala (60 hrs)</h2>
        <p><slide>This project was a personal project that I developped to improve the experience of the "Nuit des Fignos" Gala - Arts et Métiers ParisTech Gala (Lille). In order to improve the experience of our guests, we looked back at their feedbacks. And this was the most popular opinion : "The waiting and the management of the cloakroom is a catastrophe !". Therefore, I decided to change it !</slide></p>
	<slide><img src="cloakroom_vide.png" alt="empty cloakroom" width=50% height=50% text-align=center></slide>
	<p><slide>This year, we were waiting 3,000 guests but the challenge was even greater because for the first year in 25 years the Gala took place out of the school. That additional constraint obligate us to be even more professional in the management of the event than before. So I started by studying the previous Gala: their weaknesses and their strenghts. Thanks to Mister Quenehen i managed to analyze the previous editions Gant diagrams and reports, allowing me to understand the major issues of this cloakroom. Those precious informations firstly highlighted that every guests had to much "work" to do to give their clothes and secondly that every worker of the cloakroom where lost in the organization due to its unclarity. This was the two biggest chalenges !</slide></p>
	<p><slide>Service improvement:</slide></p>
	<p><slide>As we already use QR code to manage the entry of the Gala, I decided to use the same QR code for the cloakroom. In fact, when the guest come to the cloakroom we scan his QR Code with the computer camera and then we scan the bar code of the storage holder. In this way, the clothes are linked with the QR Code andare stored at the storage holder we attributed to it. Moreover, we decided to add tag on the clothes as well as on the hangers to be sure to perfectly matched every clothes with its storage holder. This new process was also very efficient when the guests came back to pick up their clothes. In fact, when scanning the QR Code a second time it gives you the storage Holder and allow you to find the clothes easily.</slide></p>

	<p><slide>Cloakroom formalization:</slide></p>
	<p><slide>Thanks to my warehouse operator experiences, i managed to improve the cloakroom organization. In fact, I used a XX-00-00 combination as a logical localization of the hanger : first XX for the letter of the column (from A to H), then 00 for the number of the gantry (from 1 to 12) and finally 00 for the number of the hanger on the gantry (from 1 to 35). This organization was better understandable than before. Moreover, we also decided to increase the number of desk with 4 desks from the beginning to midnight and then 6 desks from midnight to 4am. </slide></p>
      	<slide><img src="cloakroom_plan.png" alt="cloakroom plan" width=20% height=10%></slide>
	<p><slide>Finally, thanks to our new scanning program and the new organization, we were allowed to extract very important data to analyze the flow of people, flow of clothes and effectivenes of the cloakroom. (Analysis in coming)</slide></p>
	<p><slide>Thanks to this project, I managed to understand the usefulness of the industrial engineering tools such as the takt time or the Gantt diagram but also I was allowed to live a beautiful human project, part of the quest of the Gala improvement.</slide></p>
