        <h2>Experiences</h2>
		<p><strong><a href="https://amje-lille.fr/">Arts et Métiers Junior Enterprise</a>, Lille, Business Manager:</strong> Being part of the business team of the junior enterprise is drafting proposals through sales prospecting or directly for interested companies. But also secure contracts and then managed the intervenor in charge of it. During the past year, I have generated 5K € out of 23k € annual revenue and delivered 6 successful missions to clients. I also organized a business event for more than 60 people (5k € contract).</p>
  		<p><strong><a href="https://www.renault-trucks.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/industrial-tourism-tour-renault-trucks-factory-bourg-en-bresse-home-0">Renault Trucks</a>, Bourg-en-Bresse, Blue collar Internship:</strong> Last summer, I completed my blue-collar internship in a Renault Trucks (Mack Trucks in the US) factory. During this one-month internship, I Assembled 2,340 Mudguards on the production line. Being on the production line cast a new light on my understanding of this industrial work. I had the opportunity to improve ergonomic aspects of the workstation in which I was working and design a new pneumatic command that I 3D printed afterward.</p>
	  	<p><strong><a href="https://groupe-jcvagri.fr/">Group JCV Agri</a>, Saône et Loire, Warehouse man:</strong> Since the summer of 2021, I began working as a warehouse operator. In 2023, I received, followed up and sold spare parts to more than 150 clients during 2 consecutive months. In 2024, I designed and installed a new workshop in the Poligny site. And in 2025, I reorganized spare parts storage by category while stocktaking to save space in the Saint-Germain du Bois site. During these 5 years I learnt about specific agricultural machinery spare parts utility, sales techniques and warehouse operation. I also saved the equivalent of 1000 sq ft, created 800 sq ft of workshop used as self-service and 500 sq ft as spare parts storage (Poligny) </p>
